// What is Queue in Data Structures?

// A queue is a linear data structure that follows the 
// First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It operates like a line where elements are added at one 
// end (rear) and removed from the other end (front).




// Basic Operations of Queue Data Structure :-

// Enqueue (Insert): Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
// Dequeue (Delete): Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.
// Peek: Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
// Empty: Checks if the queue is empty.
// Full: Checks if the queue is full.




// Applications of Queue :-

// Task scheduling in operating systems
// Data transfer in network communication
// Simulation of real-world systems (e.g., waiting lines)
// Priority queues for event processing queues for event processing
